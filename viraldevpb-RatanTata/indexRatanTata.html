            <h2>Ratan Tata is the Chairman of Emeritus, Tata Sons and Tata Group.</h2>
            <p><i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i> Born on 28 December 1937 in Bombay</p>
            <p> He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class, followed by
                Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla.</p>
            <p><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> In 1955, graduated from Riverdale Country School in New York City.
            </p>
            <p> Promoted to management during the 1970s; he then endured trial by
                ordeal and was able to turn Group company National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it
                collapse during an economic slowdown. </p>
            <p><i class="far fa-building"></i> In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him
                his successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many companies
                heads, some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very powerful and
                influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. He began replacing them by setting a
                retirement age, and then made individual companies report operationally to the group office and made
                each contribute some of their profit to build and use the Tata group brand.</p>
            <p> During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and
                profit, over 50 times. Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from commodities
                when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited. He boldly got Tata Tea to
                acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire <a href="https://www.jaguar.in/index.html">Jaguar</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.landrover.in/index.html">Land Rover</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.tatasteel.com/">Tata Steel</a> to acquire
                Corus. All this
                turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% revenues coming
                from operations and sales in over 100 countries. He conceptualised the Tata Nano car. In
                2015, He explained in an interview for the Harvard Business School's Creating Emerging Markets project,
                the development of the Tata Nano was significant because it helped put cars at a price-point within
                reach of the average Indian consumer.</p>
